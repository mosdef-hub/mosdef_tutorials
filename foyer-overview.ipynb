    "## Foyer Overview\n",
    "Foyer is designed to be a force field agnostic tool for performing atom-typing that can output to various file formats. That is, the goal is to create a single, flexible tool that can work with a range of force fields and simulation engines, rather than creating software specific to a single forcefield/simulation engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key goal of Foyer is to allow force field usage to be unambiguous and the abilication of force fields to be reproducible.  Foyer employs a force field file format that is:\n",
    "- simultaneously human and machine readable\n",
    "- can be automatically validated\n",
    "- easy to disseminate \n",
    "- easy to evolve and expand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Format\n",
    "Foyer force fields are defined within an XML file that contains both the 'rules' required for atomtyping as well as the force field parameters within a single file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Foyer XML format is an extension of the [OpenMM forcefield XML format](http://docs.openmm.org/7.0.0/userguide/application.html#creating-force-fields). The only differences reside in the `AtomTypes` section, where several additional attributes are available (which we will examine in a moment) that allow for atomtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AtomTypes` section of the Foyer XML is similar to that used for OpenMM forcefield XMLs; however, each `Type` in Foyer XML supports four additional attributes not found in OpenMM:\n",
    "* `def` - SMARTS string describing the chemical substructure of this atom type, as discussed later (Follow [this link](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer/blob/master/docs/smarts.md) for more on SMARTS-based atomtyping using Foyer.)\n",
    "* `desc` - Brief description of the atomtype\n",
    "* `doi` - DOI reference for parameters associated with this atomtype\n",
    "* `overrides` - One or more atomtypes to 'override', providing precedence to this atomtype (discussed later)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the usage rules are encoded in a text file outside of the software itself, rules can be evolved and corrected without changing the software itself; it also makes it easier to develop and distribute new force fields and subsets specific to a project/manuscript. \n",

    "## Defining Chemical Context (i.e., \"Rules\") using SMARTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical force fields are typically able to achieve high accuracy by creating sets of highly specific fitting parameters (i.e., atom types), in which each atom type describes an interaction site within a different chemical context. The chemical context is typically defined by the bonded environment of an interaction site (e.g., the number of bonds and the identity of the bonded neighbors) and may also consider, among other factors, the bonded environment of the neighbors, and/or the specific molecule/structure within which the interaction site is included.  Chemical context effectively defines the 'rules' for when an atomtype should apply. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foyer relies upon using [SMARTS](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) to define the chemical context of an atom-type. SMARTS is a language for describing chemical structures and substructures.  In Foyer we tend focus on substructures, rather than trying to describe the entire molecule in a single string, given that the goal is to uniquely describe differentiate each interaction site/atom-type in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example, Methane: \n",
    "Consider defining the chemical context of the atoms (i.e., interactions sites) in a methane molecule ($CH_4$) using SMARTS.  The first thing to note is that there are multiple valid SMARTS that could describe the atom.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carbon:\n",
    "- For example, the simplest way to describe the carbon atom in methane would be:\n",
    " - ```C``` \n",
    "- While in some cases such a simple definition may be sufficient, typically we wish to also define the number of bond, e.g.:\n",
    " - ```[C;X4]```\n",
    " - Note, ```;``` represents ```AND```, thus stating that the atom is a carbon AND it has 4 bonds. \n",
    "- Often it is useful to further define the identity of those bonds. In this case, we would typically describe methane as: \n",
    " - ```[C;X4](H)(H)(H)(H)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hydrogen:\n",
    "- Since hydrogen can only form a single bond, we could simply define it as:\n",
    " - ```H```\n",
    " - however, this may be insufficient as the parameters will likely be different based on what it is bonded to. \n",
    "- Additional specificity can be encoded by providing information about the neighbors, e.g.:\n",
    " - ```H(C)``` \n",
    " - this specifies this hydrogen must be bonded to a carbon.\n",
    "- This could be made further specific by further specifyin that this is a hydrogen that is bonded to a carbon with four bonds. \n",

    "`Foyer` allows rule precedence to be explicitly stated via the use of the `overrides` attribute added to the XML file format. This allows atom type usage rules to be encoded in any order within the file, eliminating incorrectly placed rule order as a source of error. This approach also means that all rules are evaluated, helping to better ensure completeness and remove ambiguity.  Providing the `overrides` indicates that if the `opls_145` pattern matches, it will supersede `opls_142`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Foyer` iteratively evaluates all rules on all interaction sites in the system, maintaining for each interaction site a \"whitelist\" consisting of rules that evaluate to `True` and a \"blacklist\" consisting  of rules that have been superseded by another rule (i.e., those that appear in the `overrides` attribute). The set difference between the white- and blacklists of an interaction site yields the correct atom type if the force field is implemented correctly. Thus, in this example the difference between the whitelist (containing `opls_142` and `opls_145`) and blacklist (containing only `opls_142`) would be `opls_145`.\n"
