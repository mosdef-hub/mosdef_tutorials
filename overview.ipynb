    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "MoSDeF consists of two core Python package, [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) and [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer), that, when combined with tools for workflow and analysis management (such as Signac and Signac-Flow) provide the means to perform complex molecular simulations in a **reproducible** manner. Reproducibility in this case is achieved by making all aspects of the simulation (system initialization, simulation execution, and analysis) scriptable, such that other researchers could execute your same scripts to achieve the same results. MoSDeF is also designed such that systems can be generated in a programmatic manner, facilitating screening of large structural/chemical parameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this overview, we will be focusing specifically on the tools we've developed to address the issue of system initialization, including the creation of a molecular model and the application of a force field (atom-typing and parameter assignment). The two tools contained within MoSDeF to address system initialization are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **mBuild**: A hierarchical, component based molecule builder\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Foyer**: A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview is designed to introduce you to these tools in a general manner; however, more in-depth tutorials are also available from within the [mosdef_tutorials repository](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mosdef_tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed this tutorial for users that have some knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming (OOP). However, we encourage all users to work through the notebook, even those new to the world of Python and OOP, in order to still obtain an idea of the general concept of our tools. The syntax can be picked up later.\n",
