    "### The `Compound` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class of mBuild is the `Compound` class, which defines the primary building block used for constructing molecules. Molecules are constructed hierarchically; however, each level of the hierarchy inherits from the `Compound` class. This means that `Compounds` may contain other `Compounds`, and that the same methods and attributes are present for molecule components at any level of the hierarchy. mBuild `Compounds` feature [a variety of useful methods and attributes](http://mosdef-hub.github.io/mbuild/data_structures.html) to facilitate system construction.\n",

    "### Creating `Compounds`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways that `Compounds` can be created with mBuild. The simplest is to construct them from `Particles`. The `Particle` class is used to define `Compounds` residing at the lowest level of the containment hierarchy. Standard mBuild protocol is to define `Particle` names according to their elemental symbol (e.g. `'C'`), or to preface `Particle` names by an underscore for non-atomistic particles (e.g. `'_CH4'` for a united-atom methane). This aids in the atomtyping and forcefield application process (using the Foyer package) which will be addressed in later tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets create a simple carbon `Particle`. [Several arguments are available](http://mosdef-hub.github.io/mbuild/data_structures.html#mbuild.compound.Compound) to set various `Compound`/`Particle` attributes upon instantiation. Here, we'll use the `name` argument to specify the element of our `Particle` and the `pos` argument to specify the location of the `Particle` in Cartesian space.\n",
